## Overview

Committer is a simple tool that generates meaningful commit messages for you. Additionally, it allows you the developer to:
- Stage all files if none are staged
- Commit all staged files, if the generated commit message is acceptable, otherwise it can generate a new commit message, or allow you to enter your own
- Push the committed changes to the remote repository
- Tag the commit with a version number
